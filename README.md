# Face-and-moving-object-detection
This repository contains two python notebooks. One is for face detection and the other is for moving object detection.

Both notebooks use the most popular python library for computer vision: openCV. The library uses machine learning algorithms (Haar cascades) for face detection within the picture or on the camera stream and it uses frame differencing for moving object detection.
